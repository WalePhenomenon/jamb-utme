# UTME 2025 Score Analysis (Simulated)

This project presents a statistical analysis of the 2025 UTME score distribution using simulated candidate-level data, based on publicly released band counts from JAMB. The goal is to demonstrate what a more informative and actionable analysis could look like.

## Contents
- üìÑ `UTME_2025_Analysis.pdf` ‚Äì Full report with plots, summary statistics, and recommendations
- üìä Plots used in the report (`.png`)
- üß™ `simulate_data.ipynb` ‚Äì Python code to generate the data, analysis, and visuals

## Highlights
- Realistic simulation using truncated normal distributions
- Score distribution, quantile breakdown, and outlier detection
- Statistical testing (t-test, ANOVA, Mann‚ÄìWhitney)
- Recommendations for improving UTME data transparency and policy relevance

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This analysis uses simulated data and does not represent actual candidate-level UTME scores.
